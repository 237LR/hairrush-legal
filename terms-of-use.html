    <h2>5. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
    
    <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Your use of the App is at your sole risk. The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis.

    <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
    
    <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
    
    <p>By continuing to access or use our App after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the App.</p>
